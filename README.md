# TODO
To improve upon this
- [ ] PyPDFLoader doesn't work well with images and tables, so currently we can only reliably parse text documents. 
- [x] Bug related to Chromadb libraries
- [ ] Test a new embedding (ada embedding is not able to search the title of other papers)
- [ ] Test with latest OpenAI LLM
- [ ] Summarizer
- [ ] Reviewer
- [ ] RAG Agents to query similar papers from internet
- [ ] Clustering or extracting embeddings from papers (to check related papers in local)
- [ ] UI wrt to table -> think of a better output
